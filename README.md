# Othello

This is a joint school project for the [Faculty of Mathemathics and Physics Ljubljana](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/sl/ "Faculty of Mathemathics and Physics Ljubljana") for the class Programiranje 2.

 The project uses the [Monte Carlo tree search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) to create an intelligent AI to play the game [Othello](https://www.worldothello.org/about/about-othello/othello-rules/official-rules/english).

# How to play

To play a game compile and run `App.java` from `Othello/src/app/`.
